    <h2>Great Time Together</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        Time spent together with your family creates loyalty to each other and a feeling of support and belonging.
        Our children grow up fast so we should use the time we have meaningfully.  If we manage to spend time 
        together as a family, we will make it easier for our children to share their thoughts an worries when 
        going through tougher times.  We should set our phones, TVs, laptops and other distractions aside and 
        instead share ideas and learn about what is happening in each other lives. Board, card games are great 
        ways to create fun and unforgettable memories.
